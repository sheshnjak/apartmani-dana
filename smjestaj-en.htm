<h1>Nautical and geographical placement </h1>
<p><a href="http://www.tomislavdekovic.iz.hr/gmap-eng.html" title="Sattelite imagery of Turanj"><img src="slike/arhipelag.jpg" alt="Satelitska snimka Turnja" width="300" height="456" border="0" align="left" /></a>Turanj is a traditional Dalmatian village with population around 1200. It is placed on the northern Pašman channel coastline, just in center of a archipelago with 16 islands. Just between Turanj and Pašman there is a channel neck and it causes strong sea current, which is a world rarity because it flows both ways. In ancient time there was a watermill driven by current. </p>
<p>You won't have much trouble explaining yachtsmen where is Turanj and what it looks like. They all know where is it because of famous Biograd regatta which starts and ends in Biograd, and it's turn and most exciting part takes place among islands below Turanj. This archipelago is not only famous among sailing boats owners, but among most of the people that know Croatian coastline well enough. The  biggest Croatian marina &quot;Sukošan&quot; is only 10 km away from Turanj. </p>
<p>The feeling of being on the sea where you can't see shoreline is somewhat beautiful and unreal, but it's much more comforting and calming to navigate the sea when you see the shores. It helps people that are not accustomed to the sea to relax and enjoy navigation.</p>
<h2>Geographical placement</h2>
<p>Adriatic highway (until last year most important road in Croatia) passes through Turanj, which makes it easily approachable by car. Besides that, bigger transport center Zadar is  20 km away with it's port and international airport. Only 6 km to the southeast there's another old historical town - Biograd. It used to be a royal town and it has rather interesting history, much like Turanj. </p>
<p>If you make a circle, 100 km in diameter with center in Turanj you could count three national parks and two nature reserve parks. These are definitely not only places worth visiting in our surroundings. There's one interesting tale about God sharing countries to nations, and when he thought that he shared it all, Croats came to him and ask him for their part. He did not know what to do, but wanted to be fair so he says: &quot;OK, I'll give you this country that I ment to save for myself.&quot; That explains why Croatia is so beautiful in it's variety of natural beauties, from mountains to islands and lowlands.</p>
